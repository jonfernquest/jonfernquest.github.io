### Classical Southeast Asian Languages: Sanskrit, Pali, Burmese & Tai 

Translation of historical, philosophical and literary classics, along with investigation into the origins of local indigenous literary literary registers using Pali and Sanskrit traditions as a foundation. 

Classical Southeast Asian literary traditions such as those built upon the Javanese, Burmese and Tai languages were built upon the Indian languages of Pali and Sanskrit. My work here focuses on mustering the wealth of lexical and grammatical information for these languages and to deploy this for a more thorough understanding and translation of the original Indian languages as well as a deeper understanding of the Southeast Asian literary traditions that derive from them. 

Specifically, towards this end automatic flashcard generation to acquire lexical depth and the creation of interlinear translation workspaces bringing lexically and grammtically rich content to the reader for deeper understanding of the poetic stanzas (Sanskrit: slokas) that populate these classical literary traditions. 

Integration of interlinear translation with flashcards is one goal of this project. An example of how flashcards and their corresponding grammatical paradigms is provided with the Reveal.js framework [here](https://jonfernq.github.io/reveal.js/noun_paradigms_reveal.html). Examples of interlinear translation in html format ([here](https://jonfernquest.github.io/assets/bhagavadgita_interlinear_11.html)) and plain text format ([here](https://jonfernquest.github.io/assets/bhagavad_git_interlinear_wkspc_11.txt)) as well as LaTex and TeX format are part of this research.
