**Flashcards**

The following is a list of flashcard sets that have been created automatically by 
mining certain digital resources such as Sanskrit and Pali dictionaries and grammars. Note that these large sets of flashcards were generated automatically with a Python program that used the [Digital Corpus of Sanskrit (DCS)](http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/dcs/) by Oliver Hellwig (see [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-hellwig-a1640322/?originalSubdomain=de), [projects](http://www.sanskritreader.de/) and [news](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/07/02/gpus-ai-ancient-sanskrit/), [papers](https://uzh.academia.edu/OliverHellwig), [repository](https://github.com/OliverHellwig)). A wealth of Sanskrit dictionaries in computer readable form were also used for flashcard creation, being from another source (see [here](https://github.com/indic-dict/stardict-sanskrit)). 

This Sanskrit Self-Learning project uses [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) framework as a flashcard presentation engine (see [noun paradigms and corresponding flashcards](https://jonfernq.github.io/reveal.js/noun_paradigms_reveal.html) from well-known 'Red Book' of Sanskrit grammatical paradigms by McComas Taylor of ANU in pdf form [here](https://www.sheshnaag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/litte_red_book.pdf) and online [here](http://littleredbook.vedicsociety.org.in/)). 

The automatic generation of flashcard sets from various sources aims to explore different dimensions of flashcard use, for example: 

  - For a series of slokas or chapters of a text being studied 
  - Grouped together into semantic fields in a thesaurus-like fashion, 
  - Graded by difficulty
  - Words presented in different degrees of grammatical wholeness:
  - From the raw verbal root, 
  - To stems of various verbal and noun forms, 
  - To stems in strengthened or weakened form 
  - To fully inflected stems. 

Although it requires additional human processing and consultation of commentaries analysis and breaking apart of noun and verb compounds (vigraha) is another aim of these flashcards. Here is a sample of a variety of ongoing computer-generated flashcard set experiments with Python:
