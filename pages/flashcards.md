## Flashcard Sets

The following is a list of flashcard sets that have been created automatically by 
mining certain digital resources such as Sanskrit and Pali dictionaries and grammars. Note that these large sets of flashcards were generated automatically with a Python program that used the [Digital Corpus of Sanskrit (DCS)](http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/dcs/) by Oliver Hellwig (see [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-hellwig-a1640322/?originalSubdomain=de), [projects](http://www.sanskritreader.de/) and [news](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/07/02/gpus-ai-ancient-sanskrit/), [papers](https://uzh.academia.edu/OliverHellwig), [repository](https://github.com/OliverHellwig)) or  one of a variety of Sanskrit dictionaries available in computer readable form (see [here](https://github.com/indic-dict/stardict-sanskrit)). This Sanskrit Self-Learning project also uses [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) framework as a flashcard presentation engine (see [noun paradigms and corresponding flashcards](https://jonfernq.github.io/reveal.js/noun_paradigms_reveal.html) from well-known 'Red Book' of Sanskrit grammatical paradigms by McComas Taylor of ANU in pdf form [here](https://www.sheshnaag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/litte_red_book.pdf) and online [here](http://littleredbook.vedicsociety.org.in/)). Here is a sample of computer-generated flashcard set experiments with Python:
